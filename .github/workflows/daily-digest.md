# Daily Digest

Every weekday, create a GitHub issue that summarises all open issues
and pull requests in this repository. Group them by label. Include the
total count, the title, the author, and how long each item has been
open. Title the issue "Daily Digest – <date>".

## Instructions

Replace this section with specific instructions for the AI. For example:

1. Read the issue description and comments
2. Analyze the request and gather relevant information
3. Provide a helpful response or take appropriate action

Be clear and specific about what the AI should accomplish.

## Notes

- Run `gh aw compile` to generate the GitHub Actions workflow
